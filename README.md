## Bank-Marketing

A European Banking Institution has provided data related to direct marketing campaigns. The campaigns were based on phone calls to their customers in order to offer term deposit subscriptions.

In this project, we will build classification models to predict ***whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not*** and also to identify ***the main factors that affect the clientsâ€™ decision.***

## Dataset Information

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

There are two dataset:
1. bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]
2. bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.

The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM). 

Detial about dataset is provided in Readme.md file in ***data folder***
